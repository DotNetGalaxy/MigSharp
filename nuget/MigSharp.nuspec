    <releaseNotes>
3.2.1
- optimized initialization of DbSchema and Migrator instances
3.2
- added support for fast-forwarding using aggregate migrations
- Generate command line tool:
  - Auto-generate aggregate migrations
  - Include data as INSERT statements
  - Support scripting of schemas, deletion cascading, support more data types
  - Various fixes
BREAKING CHANGES:
- MigrationOptions.MigrationSelector replaces MigrationOptions.ModuleSelector and IMigrationBatch.RemoveAll
- IMigrationStepMetadata replaces IScheduleMigrationMetadata
3.1.3
- added support for new (sequential and random) GUID as default value on existing columns too
3.1.2
- added support for new (sequential and random) GUID as default value
- hard-coded public enum member values to not force recompilation of consumers of 3.1.x (SqlServerCe was removed from Platforms in 3.1.0; see: "Robust Programming" section on https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbbt4032.aspx)
3.1.1
BUG FIXES:
- SQL Server: dropping or renaming a default constraint was not prefixing the schema of the corresponding table
- 3.1.0 was wrongly built in our CI environment and was requiring .NET 4.6.1 bindings (string.Format)
3.1.0
- Added support for current UTC datetime as default (#37)
- Added support for current datetimeoffset as default (SQL Server only)
- New API to selectively execute pending migrations (see: IMigrationBatch.RemoveAll)
- Removed support for SQL Server CE (deprecated by Microsoft in 2013)
BUG FIX:
- SQLite: using HavingCurrentDateTimeAsDefault correctly set the date time to local format instead of GMT/UTC
3.0.0
- New API dedicated to schema altering (see: DbAlterer; replaces Migrator.BypassMigration)
- Support for SQL Server Schemata (#33)
  - Migrations can specify to use their Module name as the default schema
  - Versioning table can reside in a custom schema too
  - Generate.exe reads out schema names too
- Keeps tracks of ordering of commands even when return types are stored in variables (#60)
- Migration metadata is exposed on the callback context
- Mig# now targets .NET 4.5
BREAKING CHANGES:
- IMPORTANT: database platforms to be included in compatibility validations must be specified explicitly in the options. Mig# cannot (and therefore should not) make any assumptions about your setup.
- A new type called DbPlatform has been introduced to specify database platforms (replaces ProviderNames); providers are now identified by platform, major version, and driver

Note: Mig# uses "Semantic Versioning" http://semver.org/ (by Tom Preston-Werner)
