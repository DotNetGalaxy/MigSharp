This file contains global TODOs for the next release that are not in the source code
====================================================================================

MigSharp.Cli
------------
- currently ON HOLD as there is no way to dynamically load the correct ASP.NET DbFactory (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47494955/how-to-write-a-db-agnostic-net-core-app)
- reference Microsft.Extension.CommandLineUtils for Migrate.exe (and Generate.exe) and share code?
- make sure MigSharp.Cli is published well
- document new MigSharp.Cli app

General
-------
- use optional parameters on fluent interface?
- SQLite
	- Add support for foreign keys (see https://github.com/dradovic/MigSharp/issues/2)
- document UseCustomConnection
- document custom versioning
- document TemporaryDefault feature
- fix all FIXME and NotImplementedException

Nice-to-have/backlog:
- try AppVeyor / CoverAlls.io
- search for FEATURE
- see Roadmap in GitHub Wiki
